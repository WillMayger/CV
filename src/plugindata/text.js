  { text: `I have been working in web development professionally for the last 3 - 4 years. I originally started because I had a deep fascination with being able to create things with a computer. The first bit of code I wrote was for making a macronutrients calculator for fitness when I was 16 years old in C#. Ever since I have been completely obsessed with development. The only part of my motives that have changed is that I found I love web development the most, especially with Node.js, which I discovered after I started my apprenticeship in London with the company, Atos.

Web development is a deep passion for me, even after I finish a day of work I will happily go home and work on personal projects that usually involve using new technologies to keep me learning and pushing myself forward, not to mention keeping up with the current standards. It fills my need to be challenged and be creative.

I also like to work until the task at hand is complete, at both work, and personal things. Due to this I have a tendency to annoy my girlfriend when working on projects as It takes a while to pull me away from the screen!

As a side note, I am actively learning french with a native speaker, my girlfriend (ma petite amie!). I often go over to France to visit her family who do not speak a word of english. This suits me well though as I like the challenge and the learning I get from speaking with them and seeing different parts of the world.`,

I want a role that will keep pushing me and challenging me to learn and improve on new skills as well as build on my existing ones. I would like to take on plenty of responsibilities as In my current position we have a lot of responsibilities, builds, tickets and deployments to do with little time to do it so I am used to working under pressure.`,
