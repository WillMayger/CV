During my time at Atos, however, from day one I started learning about, and putting to use, JS, Node.Js, CSS, HTML, Jquery and Git. I made many internal applications that helped different departments handle certain things such as an application to help the finance department deal with invoices so there was no room for error, which meant lots of testing. During this time we used many different technologies because we chose the best for each individual task that needed to be done. (most listed above)',
