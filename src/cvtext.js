  `I have currently have 3 - 4 years of professional experience in the world of development / web development I have been exposed to a lot of different skills, technologies and processes during this time. The skills listed above are the main ones that I have worked on, however I have worked on more. The reason why I feel I have covered the amount of different things that I have is because I really enjoy learning new things, and improving on what I know.

The skills I have most experience with and am most comfortable using would be JS / Node.js, HTML, CSS, jquery, and git. This is because I have been using them all from the first day I started my career in web development at Atos / Canopy Cloud. This was a very hands on role along with a lot of research. I started developing responsive websites within the first week and throughout the duration of my time there, a lot of the time with different technologies.

After the first year we moved into a closed environment with a team of 1 Senior, 1 Mid, and 2 Juniors where we utilized Node.JS, Express.JS, and Cloud Foundry as the main tech stack to develop a GUI website for Cloudfoundry users. We were making use of the Agile methodology Extreme Programming with Pair Programming and TDD. This continued for another year before we finished and then I took the next step in my career.

 I Joined Gforces Web Management where everything is mostly focused on pixel perfect responsive websites that match designs to the pixel. We make tools in Node.js with various frameworks such as mithril.js to help us speed up the process of making and deploying websites. A couple of examples of sites I have done here are: [ http://www.gcmotors.co.uk/]( http://www.gcmotors.co.uk/),  [http://www.hwm.co.uk/](http://www.hwm.co.uk/).

  `I am currently looking for my career to progress to the next stage, so I can use all the skills I have learnt to this point and improve on them, as well as learn new and challenging things, more specifically in the world of frontend / backend Javascript. `

  `I started learning Graphics Design in school whilst doing my Photography AS and A Level. This is where I knew I had a passion in creating beautiful looking designs and photos.

After completing A-Levels with an A* in Photography, I wanted to try something new and give myself a chance to push myself past what I already knew.

I looked to the internet to start learning about coding and web development. Shortly after I got myself an apprenticeship in software and web development. Whilst in this apprenticeship I had courses supplied by QA and work on websites provided by Canopy. However I wanted to expand my knowledge so in my own time I continued looking at blogs, youtube, and sites like codecademy to learn even more. After this I spent many months with a hands on approach to learning by creating websites and software using tools such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Python, Django, node.js and react.js

During my apprenticeship I won apprentice of the year award for innovation.

After my apprenticeship had finished I was taken on as a full time employee where I went into the Research, Innovation and Incubation team where I used the Extreme programming agile methodology. I was closely paring each day with senior developers and a designer in which we used react and node.js to begin with and then changed to using just node.js with express. In my free time I continued to create websites until in the new year a local cricket club needed a new website creating. From this point onwards I have been doing private work in my free time which has really expanded my skills and knowledge.

After, I was moved into Engineering within Atos which was solely setting up servers where I then moved my career to Gforces.

In Gforces our main aim was to create pixel perfect responsive websites for some huge clients in the vehicle industry. The websites we make have to work for every pixel from 320px to 1920px on every browser that has a big enough user base.

In Gforces we use bespoke software to get things running quickly. There is the software the websites run off of and then the software that we use to help us build the sites. I took it upon myself to actively help add to the software that help us build sites (built with node.js (es6), Mithril.js and electron). We also have to use some pretty complex front end javascript and jquery on the sites for a lot of clients to do various, different things.
